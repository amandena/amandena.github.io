For the fourth portfolio project, the task was to add JavaScript to the previous Ruby on Rails project. At first, this seemed to be a very daunting task, so I hesitated to start. Not only was JavaScript still new to me, but I also felt that it would be easier to start from scratch than to work from a previously completed application. Converting a mostly Ruby and Active Record-based project to JavaScript was difficult to wrap my head around. Fortunately for me, once I finally got started, it appeared to be more and more plausible that this was going to work. I was able to finish the project within a couple of weeks, which is actually record time for me.

I would describe the application as a portal where users can create costume parties and costumes that both belong to a user and a particular party that they are "attending." I used my costume parties model to complete the new JavaScript requirements for this project. The costume parties index page and costume party show page were converted with JavaScript and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend. On the show page of a costume party is where I demonstrated my 'has_many" relationship, which displays the many costumes going to the party. Keeping with the theme, the form submission requirement was met by utilizing a submit request click handler on the new costume party which will render the newly created party solely with JavaScript.

What I found really beneficial with this particular project were the tutorials that were provided by Flatiron's Cernan Bernardo. Following along with his videos was what helped me get a real jump start on the tasks at hand and to lay down the basic foundation of the JavaScript file. I think that I would have been at a loss as to where to start, if not for his videos.

Another helpful resource that I seem to be using more and more are the study groups for the portfolio projects. When I get stuck with specific errors and Google fails me, the study groups have been my go to. Working with Dalia Sawaya for this project has not only been fun, but also provided me with valuable tools that I can now implement on my own. One of those such tools was debugging, something that I didn't have much experience with using. Before our study sessions, I was a slave to using console.log(). Console.log() is extremely helpful, don't get me wrong, but because JavaScript was made for the web it makes more sense to be able to use the browser tools to debug issues in real time.

From starting this project to now, I feel that I have gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript and how to implement it dynamically in web applications. It has shown me why JavaScript is so widely used today and how I will be able to utilize it for future, more complicated applications.
